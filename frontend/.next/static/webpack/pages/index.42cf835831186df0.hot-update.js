I tend to listen more than I speak, and I think they would say I'm thoughtful and considerate, always taking time to process things before responding. I believe they appreciate my calm presence and my ability to offer a listening ear when needed.\",\n    \"A question people often ask me is, 'Are you okay?' or 'What's on your mind?' because I tend to be very reserved and quiet, especially in group settings. They might think something is wrong because I'm not as expressive as others, but usually, I'm just lost in my thoughts or observing the situation around me.\",\n    \"My hero is my mother. She has always been a source of strength and inspiration for me, handling life's challenges with grace and resilience. Her ability to stay positive and supportive, even in difficult times, has taught me so much about compassion and perseverance.\",\n    \"My greatest accomplishment is graduating from college. It was a long and challenging journey, but I worked hard and stayed focused on my goals. Achieving that milestone gave me a sense of pride and confidence that I can overcome obstacles and succeed in life.\",\n    \"When I deal with failure, I tend to retreat into myself for a bit to process what happened. I reflect on the experience to understand where things went wrong and what I can learn from it. It can be difficult, but I try to view failure as an opportunity for growth and self-improvement.\",\n    \"The three people I'm closest to in my life are my best friend, my sister, and my partner. Each of them offers me different kinds of support and understanding, and they have all played significant roles in my life. They know me deeply and accept me for who I am, which is incredibly comforting.\",\n    \"I'm most proud of my ability to stay true to myself. In a world where there's a lot of pressure to conform, I've managed to hold on to my values and beliefs, even if it means standing apart from the crowd. It hasn't always been easy, but it's something I value deeply.\",\n    \"In my free time, when I have no plans, I love to read books. Getting lost in a good story helps me relax and escape from the stresses of everyday life. I also enjoy taking walks in nature, where I can think and reflect in a peaceful setting.\",\n    \"My greatest personal obstacle is my shyness. It sometimes prevents me from fully engaging with people or seizing opportunities that come my way. I'm always working on being more confident and open, but it's a gradual process, and I have to be patient with myself.\",\n    \"My favorite place I've ever visited is a small, quiet beach town where I spent a week on vacation. The serene environment, the sound of the waves, and the beauty of the ocean were incredibly calming and rejuvenating. It's a place I dream of returning to whenever I need a mental escape.\",\n    \"My most vivid memory from when I was a child is playing in the garden with my siblings. We would create elaborate games and adventures, using our imagination to turn the backyard into a magical world. Those carefree days of fun and creativity are something I cherish deeply.\",\n    \"I think the most significant issue society is currently facing is the lack of empathy and understanding among people. There's so much division and conflict, often because people aren't willing to listen to different perspectives or show compassion. I believe fostering empathy is crucial for building a more harmonious world.\",\n    \"If I could change one thing about my personality, it would be my tendency to overthink things. This often leads to unnecessary stress and anxiety, and I sometimes miss out on the joy of the present moment. Learning to let go and trust myself more would be a big improvement.\",\n    \"If I discovered something wrong with my car, the first thing I'd do is call my dad or a friend who knows about cars. I'm not very knowledgeable about car mechanics, so I rely on the expertise of those I trust to help me figure out the next steps.\",\n    \"To offer sympathy to my friends when they're experiencing life challenges, I usually try to be a good listener and let them know I'm there for them. I offer kind words and support, and sometimes I give them a small token of comfort, like their favorite snack or a thoughtful note, to show I care.\",\n    \"To manage stress, I often turn to activities like reading, meditating, or going for a walk. These help me clear my mind and regain a sense of calm. Sometimes, talking to a close friend or family member also helps, as they can offer a different perspective or simply provide a listening ear.\",\n    \"As a child, my favorite activity was drawing. I loved creating pictures of imaginary worlds and characters, and I could spend hours lost in my own creativity. Drawing was a way for me to express myself and explore my imagination freely.\",\n    \"The happiest time of my life was when I graduated from college. The sense of accomplishment and the joy of celebrating that milestone with my loved ones was overwhelming. It was a culmination of years of hard work and dedication, and the pride I felt was immense.\",\n    \"One type of comment I would never make to another person is anything that could hurt their feelings or undermine their confidence. I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, and I always strive to be mindful of my words and their impact on others.\",\n    \"At social gatherings, I tend to stick with people I know. I'm not very comfortable approaching new people, and I feel more at ease when I'm around familiar faces. However, if someone new comes up to me and starts a conversation, I'm always polite and try my best to engage.\",\n    \"When I'm assigned a long-term project, I usually wait a bit before starting. I like to take some time to plan and organize my thoughts before diving in. Once I have a clear idea of what I need to do, I can work more efficiently and stay on track.\",\n    \"I make important decisions by weighing the pros and cons and considering the potential outcomes. I like to gather as much information as possible and sometimes seek advice from trusted friends or family. Ultimately, I rely on my intuition to guide me in making the best choice.\",\n    \"My daily routine includes waking up early, having a quiet breakfast while reading or listening to music, and then starting my day. I like to have some time to myself in the morning to set a positive tone for the day. In the evenings, I unwind by reading or watching a show before going to bed.\",\n    \"My favorite type of social event is a small, intimate gathering with close friends. I feel more comfortable in these settings where I can have meaningful conversations and really connect with people. Large parties or crowded events tend to overwhelm me.\",\n    \"I prefer to read a book over watching a movie. There's something about getting lost in the pages of a book and imagining the story in my own way that I find incredibly enjoyable. Reading allows me to escape into different worlds and experiences, which I love.\",\n    \"I do believe that others generally have good intentions. While not everyone acts in the best way all the time, I think most people mean well and are trying their best. Approaching others with this belief helps me to be more understanding and compassionate.\"\n];\nconst answers_open_questions_2 = [\n    \"People close to me would probably describe me as courageous and visionary. I always strive to stand up for what I believe in, and I’m not afraid to take risks to make positive changes. They see me as someone who is passionate and driven by a strong sense of justice and integrity.\",\n    \"A question people often ask me is, 'How do you stay so motivated?' They’re curious about my energy and determination, especially when tackling big projects or causes. I think it’s because I’m deeply committed to my ideals and the vision I have for a better future, which keeps me going even when things get tough.\",\n    \"My hero is Mahatma Gandhi. His unwavering commitment to non-violence and his ability to inspire mass movements for social change have always inspired me. Gandhi’s dedication to justice and equality, and his courage to stand against oppression, serve as a powerful example for how one person can make a tremendous impact on the world.\",\n    \"My greatest accomplishment is organizing a community initiative to clean up our local parks. It took a lot of effort to rally volunteers, secure funding, and coordinate the logistics, but seeing the transformation of the parks and the renewed sense of community pride was incredibly rewarding. It showed me the power of collective action.\",\n    \"When I deal with failure, I face it head-on and analyze what went wrong. I view failure as a stepping stone to success, a necessary part of the journey toward achieving something meaningful. Each setback is a learning experience that helps me improve and become stronger, and I never let it deter me from my goals.\",\n    \"The three people I’m closest to in my life are my mentor, my best friend, and my partner. My mentor guides me with wisdom and experience, my best friend supports me with unwavering loyalty, and my partner shares my dreams and values. They all inspire and challenge me to be my best self.\",\n    \"I’m most proud of my work advocating for environmental sustainability. Seeing the tangible results of my efforts, whether it’s a new recycling program or increased community awareness about climate change, gives me immense pride. I believe in leaving the world better than I found it, and this work embodies that belief.\",\n    \"In my free time, when I have no plans, I enjoy reading about social movements and innovations. I also like to spend time in nature, hiking or biking, as it rejuvenates my spirit and gives me fresh ideas. Staying active and informed helps me stay motivated and connected to my ideals.\",\n    \"My greatest personal obstacle is balancing my idealism with practicality. Sometimes, my lofty goals can seem overwhelming or unrealistic. However, I’ve learned to break them down into manageable steps and stay focused on what’s achievable in the present while keeping my long-term vision in sight.\",\n    \"My favorite place I’ve ever visited is the top of a mountain I climbed during a solo trek. The sense of accomplishment and the breathtaking view from the summit were unparalleled. It reminded me of the beauty of our planet and the importance of fighting to protect it.\",\n    \"My most vivid memory from when I was a child is participating in a protest march with my parents. The energy, the chants, and the sense of unity among the crowd left a lasting impression on me. It was my first experience of collective action, and it sparked my lifelong passion for social justice.\",\n    \"I think the most significant issue society is currently facing is climate change. It’s a crisis that affects every aspect of life and demands urgent and comprehensive action. Addressing it requires a shift in how we live, consume, and interact with our environment, and it’s a cause I’m deeply committed to.\",\n    \"If I could change one thing about my personality, it would be my tendency to take on too much. I often push myself to the limit because I’m so driven by my ideals. Learning to delegate and pace myself better would help me sustain my efforts and avoid burnout.\",\n    \"If I discovered something wrong with my car, the first thing I’d do is try to diagnose the problem myself or research potential issues online. If it’s beyond my capability, I’d then call a trusted mechanic. I like to be proactive and informed about issues, even if they’re outside my expertise.\",\n    \"To offer sympathy to my friends when they’re experiencing life challenges, I listen actively and offer my support in practical ways. Whether it’s helping them with a task, providing resources, or just being there for them, I aim to show that I care and that they’re not alone in their struggles.\",\n    \"To manage stress, I practice mindfulness and stay active. Meditation helps me center my thoughts and maintain a positive outlook, while physical activities like running or yoga release tension and keep me grounded. Connecting with nature also helps me reset and gain perspective.\",\n    \"As a child, my favorite activity was exploring the outdoors. I loved going on adventures in the woods, building forts, and discovering new trails. These experiences instilled in me a deep appreciation for nature and a sense of curiosity that continues to drive me today.\",\n    \"The happiest time of my life was when I successfully led a campaign to pass a local environmental protection law. The sense of achievement and the collective joy of everyone involved were incredible. It was a powerful reminder of what can be accomplished through dedication and teamwork.\",\n    \"One type of comment I would never make to another person is anything that belittles their efforts or dreams. I believe in encouraging and uplifting others, even if their goals are different from mine. Everyone deserves respect and support in their journey.\",\n    \"At social gatherings, I love to meet new people and engage in meaningful conversations. I see it as an opportunity to exchange ideas and learn from others. While I cherish my close friends, I also value the connections I can make with diverse individuals.\",\n    \"When I’m assigned a long-term project, I start right away. I like to break it down into smaller tasks and set a clear timeline. Getting an early start allows me to manage my time effectively and address any challenges that arise without feeling rushed.\",\n    \"I make important decisions by combining rational analysis with my intuition. I gather all the relevant information, consider the potential impacts, and reflect on my core values and long-term goals. I also seek advice from trusted mentors or colleagues to ensure I’m making a well-rounded choice.\",\n    \"My daily routine includes an early morning workout, followed by a nutritious breakfast and some time for reading or journaling. I then dive into my work with focused energy, taking breaks to stay refreshed. In the evenings, I wind down with a walk or some creative activity like painting.\",\n    \"My favorite type of social event is a community gathering focused on a cause I care about. Whether it’s a fundraiser, a workshop, or a volunteer event, I love being surrounded by like-minded people working towards a common goal. These events energize me and reinforce my sense of purpose.\",\n    \"I prefer to read a book over watching a movie. Books offer a depth of knowledge and insight that I find enriching and inspiring. I enjoy immersing myself in different perspectives and ideas, which fuels my creativity and broadens my understanding of the world.\",\n    \"I do believe that others generally have good intentions. While people might have different views and approaches, I think most are motivated by a desire to do good and make a positive impact.
