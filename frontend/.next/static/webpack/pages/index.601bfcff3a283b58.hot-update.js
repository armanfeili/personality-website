They might think something is wrong because I'm not as expressive as others, but usually, I'm just lost in my thoughts or observing the situation around me.\",\n    \"My hero is my mother.

I believe fostering empathy is crucial for building a more harmonious world.\",\n    \"If I could change one thing about my personality, it would be my tendency to overthink things. This often leads to unnecessary stress and anxiety, and I sometimes miss out on the joy of the present moment.

I loved creating pictures of imaginary worlds and characters, and I could spend hours lost in my own creativity. Drawing was a way for me to express myself and explore my imagination freely.\",\n    \"The happiest time of my life was when I graduated from college. The sense of accomplishment and the joy of celebrating that milestone with my loved ones was overwhelming. It was a culmination of years of hard work and dedication, and the pride I felt was immense.\",\n    \"One type of comment I would never make to another person is anything that could hurt their feelings or undermine their confidence. I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, and I always strive to be mindful of my words and their impact on others.\",\n    \"At social gatherings, I tend to stick with people I know. I'm not very comfortable approaching new people, and I feel more at ease when I'm around familiar faces. However, if someone new comes up to me and starts a conversation, I'm always polite and try my best to engage.\",\n    \"When I'm assigned a long-term project, I usually wait a bit before starting. I like to take some time to plan and organize my thoughts before diving in.

I like to have some time to myself in the morning to set a positive tone for the day. In the evenings, I unwind by reading or watching a show before going to bed.\",\n    \"My favorite type of social event is a small, intimate gathering with close friends. I feel more comfortable in these settings where I can have meaningful conversations and really connect with people. Large parties or crowded events tend to overwhelm me.\",\n    \"I prefer to read a book over watching a movie. There's something about getting lost in the pages of a book and imagining the story in my own way that I find incredibly enjoyable. Reading allows me to escape into different worlds and experiences, which I love.\",\n    \"I do believe that others generally have good intentions.

I think it’s because I’m deeply committed to my ideals and the vision I have for a better future, which keeps me going even when things get tough.\",\n    \"My hero is Mahatma Gandhi. His unwavering commitment to non-violence and his ability to inspire mass movements for social change have always inspired me. Gandhi’s dedication to justice and equality, and his courage to stand against oppression, serve as a powerful example for how one person can make a tremendous impact on the world.\",\n    \"My greatest accomplishment is organizing a community initiative to clean up our local parks. It took a lot of effort to rally volunteers, secure funding, and coordinate the logistics, but seeing the transformation of the parks and the renewed sense of community pride was incredibly rewarding. It showed me the power of collective action.\",\n    \"When I deal with failure, I face it head-on and analyze what went wrong. I view failure as a stepping stone to success, a necessary part of the journey toward achieving something meaningful. Each setback is a learning experience that helps me improve and become stronger, and I never let it deter me from my goals.\",\n    \"The three people I’m closest to in my life are my mentor, my best friend, and my partner.

They all inspire and challenge me to be my best self.\",\n    \"I’m most proud of my work advocating for environmental sustainability. Seeing the tangible results of my efforts, whether it’s a new recycling program or increased community awareness about climate change, gives me immense pride. I believe in leaving the world better than I found it, and this work embodies that belief.\",\n    \"In my free time, when I have no plans, I enjoy reading about social movements and innovations. I also like to spend time in nature, hiking or biking, as it rejuvenates my spirit and gives me fresh ideas. Staying active and informed helps me stay motivated and connected to my ideals.\",\n    \"My greatest personal obstacle is balancing my idealism with practicality. Sometimes, my lofty goals can seem overwhelming or unrealistic. However, I’ve learned to break them down into manageable steps and stay focused on what’s achievable in the present while keeping my long-term vision in sight.\",\n    \"My favorite place I’ve ever visited is the top of a mountain I climbed during a solo trek.

It was my first experience of collective action, and it sparked my lifelong passion for social justice.\",\n    \"I think the most significant issue society is currently facing is climate change. It’s a crisis that affects every aspect of life and demands urgent and comprehensive action. Addressing it requires a shift in how we live, consume, and interact with our environment, and it’s a cause I’m deeply committed to.\",\n    \"If I could change one thing about my personality, it would be my tendency to take on too much. I often push myself to the limit because I’m so driven by my ideals. Learning to delegate and pace myself better would help me sustain my efforts and avoid burnout.\",\n    \"If I discovered something wrong with my car, the first thing I’d do is try to diagnose the problem myself or research potential issues online. If it’s beyond my capability, I’d then call a trusted mechanic. I like to be proactive and informed about issues, even if they’re outside my expertise.\",\n    \"To offer sympathy to my friends when they’re experiencing life challenges, I listen actively and offer my support in practical ways. Whether it’s helping them with a task, providing resources, or just being there for them, I aim to show that I care and that they’re not alone in their struggles.\",\n    \"To manage stress, I practice mindfulness and stay active.
